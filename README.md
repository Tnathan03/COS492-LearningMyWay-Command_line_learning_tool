## Introduction

This is my Covenant College Capstone Project for May 2023 BA in Computer Science.

LearningMyWay is a learning tool that creates small practice tests out of questions sets entered by the user. It is meant to be a resource to help students study and learn efficiently on their local devices.

## Features 
- Users enter a question input text file of their own questions formatted like "<question> | <answer>;"
- Users are tested on the questions they enter which means it can include any subject.
- Various testing options for users include multiple choice, match the following, true/false, and evaluate.
- Users can view the questions and answers as flashcards.
- A record is kept of each test which is stored in a log text file.
- Users can view the entire log history or the highscores.
